                                        We will create a mule account to hold the item(s) you ordered. The login and password of this account will be e-mailed to the e-mail address that you‚Äôve provided at checkout.

                                        After you have received the email, it is your responsibility to remove the items from the mule account before it expires. Mules expire 10 days after creation if nobody has logged into them. It is important that you get your items within that period of time.
